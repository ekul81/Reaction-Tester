# Reaction Tester
This program tests reactions by first generating a random time interval (limited to stop it becoming too large) and changing the color of the screen and recording the time difference and writing that to the screen.

## The code
Written in VB.net (.net 4.0) in 2012. It's not brilliant, but being such a simple program it *should* be without flaws.
